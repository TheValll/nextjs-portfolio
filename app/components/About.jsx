          Hello! 👋 I'm Valentin MASSONNIERE, passionate about the world of web
          and mobile development 🌐📱. Currently undergoing intensive training
          to become a web and mobile web developer, I strive every day to
          acquire new skills and master the latest industry technologies.

          My passion for programming and my desire to continuously learn have
          driven me to embark on this exciting journey 🚀. I am eager to apply
          my knowledge and skills in a professional setting, which is why I am
